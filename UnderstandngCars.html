		<h1>How Engines Work</h1>
		
			<h4><b>Gas (Otto)</b></h4>
				<ol> 
					<li><b>INTAKE: </b>Intake valve opens, Feul air drawn to cylinder, piston moves down
					<li><b>Compression: </b>Piston Reaches bottom, intake valve close, piston moves up compressing gas
					<li><b>Combustion/Power: </b>Compress gas + spak plug creates explosion. Explosion moves piston down.
					<li><b>Exhaust: </b>Once gas has burned, exhaust valve opens, Burnt gas goes out
					<li>Exhaust valve closes, intake valve opens, process repeats.

			<h4><b>Diesel</b></h4>
				<ol> 
						<li><b>INTAKE: </b>Intake valve opens, air drawn to cylinder, piston moves down
						<li><b>Compression: </b>Piston Reaches bottom, intake valve close, piston moves up compressing air heating it up
						<li><b>Combustion/Power: </b>Once air is compressed and heated, feul is injected.
						<li>Once feul comes in contact with hot compressed air, it ignites and explode.(no spark plug needed in the process)</li>
						<li>Explosion moves piston down.</li>
						<li><b>Exhaust: </b>Once gas has burned, exhaust valve opens, Burnt gas goes out
						<li>Exhaust valve closes, intake valve opens, process repeats.
